	<h1>Compressing</h1>
	<p>With Erabo Pre-Selector you can pre-select and compress any photography session; or bulk resize and share your images. Pre-Selector also keeps the original files in a separate <a href="#folder-structure">folder</a> thus allowing you to edit originals later.</p>

	<h2 id="change-compression-size">Change Compression Size</h2>
	<p>You can choose the resulting image size by going to Preferences > Behaviour. There you can specify compression width. You don't need to worry about the height, Erabo resizes images preserving its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" target="new"> aspect ratio</a>.</p>

	<h2 id="moving-images">Moving vs Copying</h2>
	<p>After compression is completed, Erabo Pre-Selector will ask if you want to move or copy the original images ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format" target="new">RAW</a> Files or Original Files).</p>
	<p>Moving may be a lot faster, though this action will move images out of the source folder to the destination folder you specify.</p>
	<p>Copying will create a copy of the selected images on the destination folder. This method may take longer and will consume more storage. Although when in doubt, this option shall be preferred.</p>

	<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h2>
	<p>Pre-Selector will generate a Project Folder with 2 Folders inside:</p>
	<p><strong>Originals</strong>: Contains the original images as they are, no resize or filters applied. Usually this folder contains your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format" target="new">RAWs</a> image files (the ones produced by your camera).</p>
	<p><strong>Preselection</strong>: Contains copies of the selected images, resize and filters applied.</p>
