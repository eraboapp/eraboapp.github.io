		<h1>Compressing</h1>
		<p>Pre-selector compress or bulk resize your images so you can share them with your client for him choose the ones they one you to edit. Erabo also keep the original file in a separate <a href="#folder-structure">folder</a> so you can edit them later.</p>
	  
		<h2 id="change-compression-size">Change Compression Size</h2>
		<p>You can change the size of the compression by entering Preferences > Behaviour. There you can change the width of the image. For the height, it will keep the image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" target="new"> aspect ratio</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="moving-images">Moving vs Coping</h2>
		<p>After compression is completed, Pre-Selector will ask you if you want to move or copy your original images ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format" target="new">RAW</a> Files or Original Files).</p>
		<p>Moving your images is a lor faster but it will take the images or your camera folder and move them to your defined location.</p>
		<p>Cooping your images will create a copy of the images in your camera folder. This method will take longer.</p>
