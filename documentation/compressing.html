		<h1>Compressing</h1>
		<p>With Erabo Photoselector you can pre-select and compress any photography session; or bulk resize your images and share them with your clients. Erabo also keeps the original files in a separate <a href="#folder-structure">folder</a> thus allowing you to edit them later once a client decides the photos they like.</p>
	  
		<h2 id="change-compression-size">Change Compression Size</h2>
		<p>You can choose the resulting image's size by going to Preferences > Behaviour. There you can change the resulting image's width. You don't need to worry about they height, Erabo resizes images preserving its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" target="new"> aspect ratio</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="moving-images">Moving vs Coping</h2>
		<p>After compression is completed, Erabo Pre-Selector will ask if you want to move or copy the original images ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format" target="new">RAW</a> Files or Original Files).</p>
		<p>Moving may be a lot faster, though this action will move images out of the camera folder to the folder you select.</p>
		<p>Copying will create a copy of the selected images on the destination folder. This method may take longer and will consume more storage. When in doubt, choose this option.</p>

		<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h2>
		<p>Pre-Selector will generate a Project Folder with 2 Folders inside:</p>
		<p>Originals: Contains the original images, no with resize or filters applied. Usually this folder contains your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format" target="new">RAWs</a> image files (the ones produced by your camera).</p>
		<p>Preselection: Contains copies of the images you preselected, size and filters applied.</p>
