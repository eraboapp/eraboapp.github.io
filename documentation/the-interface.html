  <h1>The Interface</h1>
  <p>Pre-Selector is minimal by design. Mantaining MacOS look and feel, it layers the app in windows.</p>

  <h2 id="importing-images">Importing Images</h2>
  <p>just drag and drop your images folder directly into Pre-Selector or click the folder icon. For practical purposes, some cameras create a pair of images consisting of a RAW file and a JPEG file, they're the same with different format. Don't worry about that, Pre-Selector asosiate both files into one.</p>
