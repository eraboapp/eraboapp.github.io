  <h1>The Interface</h1>
  <p>Pre-Selector is minimal by design. Mantaining MacOS interface design, it layers the app in windows.</p>

  <h2 id="importing-images">Importing Images</h2>
  <p>just drag and drop your camera images folder directly into Pre-Selector or clic the folder icon. Don't worry about having duplicates of RAW files and JPG files, Pre-Selector asosiate both files into one.</p>

  <p>You can also go to File > Import Images or pressing ⇧ + ⌘ + I </p>

  <h2 id="selecting-images">Rating and Selecting Images</h2>
  <p>To select your images for compressing, click the upper-right box of the image you want to select. You can also select and rate from the <a href="#preview-mode">Preview Window</a>.</p>
