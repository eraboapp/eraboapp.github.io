    <h1>The Idea</h1>
    <p class="the-idea__introduction">
            We wanted to make a real community-driven apps ecosystem, we want photographers all over the world to join us and help us build great products.  Photographers who believe in Erabo get involved in ideas for products,  feedback & testing.

        <p>We are a small but fast-growing community of photographers, giving us feedback, suggesting new features, new apps, or just using Erabo for their work.</p>

    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        I moved in with my girlfriend which is a professional photographer and watch her frustrations with <span>workflows, high prices on camera gear, software and finance.</span>
        I manage to learn photography myself and, with with other photographers, start building a community-drivenapps apps ecosystem.
        <span>Erabo pre-selector</span> is just the first step of that.
